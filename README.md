The proposed CodimNet is an advanced model for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on EEG.  This network combines multi-branch feature extraction, designed according to the anatomical segmentation of the international 10-20 system, with the Neurodynamic Physics-Informed Neural Network (ND-PINN) to better capture the characteristics of EEG signals in AD patients.  It outperforms nine other methods on the CAUEEG dataset, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in AD identification.
## Installation

We run CodimNet and previous methods on a system running Ubuntu 22.04, with Python 3.8, PyTorch 2.1.0, and CUDA 12.1.

The effectiveness of the proposed module was systematically evaluated through the four-fold cross-validation ablation experiment, and its applicability and advantages in related tasks were verified.

## Model Visualization

In order to verify the effectiveness of CodimNet model in extracting EEG features from patients with Alzheimer's disease, a comparative analysis diagram and heat map including time-frequency graph, original PSD graph and ND-PINN treated PSD graph were constructed based on the hook function's forward propagation layer feature visualization technology.
